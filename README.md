# redditmark-bot

A Discord bot to add reddit saved image attribution watermarks. Made for fun more than anything else.

## Quick Start

```bash
BOTTOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx ROLENAME='@everyone' node index.js
```
where 
+ BOTTOKEN is the bot's token and 
+ ROLENAME (optional) is the name of a role that users need to call the bot
